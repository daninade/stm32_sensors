# STM32 Sensors Project

The goal of this project is to start working with a STM32 board (STM32F103C6T6) and get in touch with ST CUBE IDE.

In this first versions, we are going to interact with different typical sensors. Some examples of them are the ones from every Arduino-like developmente kit: button, led, servomotor, lcd, ultrasonic, joystick, etc.
